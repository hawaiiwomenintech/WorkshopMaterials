# Learning to Code in Python

Welcome to our "Learning to Code in Python" series! This is the material we'll work with for our Python meetups.  

This README2.md file is for the second session of the series.  You can also visit [README.md](https://github.com/hawaiiwomenintech/WorkshopMaterials/blob/master/python/README.md) for the first session materials.

## Learning to Code in Python Part II: Simple Linear Regression using Pytorch

The second session will focus on doing a hands-on data analysis, and we will start with a simple linear regression.
If you don't have a python project environment set up on your computer, don't worry. we will provide few online tool options. 

We plan to go through the following:
- Launching the python project environment
- Going over a brief intro to regression analysis
- Running a simple regression analysis in a simple way
- Running a regression analysis in a data science way

## Getting started
Download the session materials at https://github.com/hawaiiwomenintech/WorkshopMaterials

## Launching the python project environment

### On your device
If you have a jupyter notebook and python conda environment already set up on your computer, start your jupyter notebook

### Online Resouce
We have two options for you today.  We will walk through the process during our session today.
